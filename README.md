# CityHenge 

The CityHenge visualization was developed originally as an idea to display the use of [VECKNIK](https://github.com/Vizzuality/VECNIK) with [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmaps.org) data. The map shows the sunset angle across Louisville, KY for every day of the year, allowing you to find [LouisvilleHenge](http://www.yourmapper.com/demo/cityhenge/map.html#13/38.2444/-85.7523/9/7) events year round.
