# CityHenge 

The CityHenge visualization was developed originally as an idea to display the use of [VECKNIK](https://github.com/Vizzuality/VECNIK) with [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmaps.org) data. The map shows the sunset angle across Louisville, KY for every day of the year, allowing you to find [LouisvilleHenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattanhenge) events year round.

There is some more info about the project on this blog post
